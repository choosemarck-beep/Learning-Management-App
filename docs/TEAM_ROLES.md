## For Your Situation (Natural Language Coding)

Since you're coding with natural language without coding knowledge, you'll primarily need:

1. **AI Agents** (like me!) - Handle implementation
2. **You** - Product Owner role (define requirements, make decisions)
3. **Optional: UI/UX Designer** - Create wireframes and designs (or use AI tools)

The AI agents can handle:
- Frontend development
- Backend development
- Database design
- DevOps setup
- Code quality

You focus on:
- Defining features
- User experience decisions
- Content creation
- Testing and feedback
- Product strategy
