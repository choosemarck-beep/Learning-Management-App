# Wireframes Documentation

This directory contains wireframes and design documentation for the Learning Management Web App.

## Structure

- `/user-flows` - User journey maps and flow diagrams
- `/components` - Component-level wireframes
- `/pages` - Page-level wireframes
- `/interactions` - Interaction states and animations

## Wireframing Guidelines

1. **Create wireframes BEFORE implementation**
2. Update wireframes as features evolve
3. Include responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
4. Document interaction states (hover, active, disabled, loading)
5. Reference design system colors and typography

## Tools

- Figma (recommended for high-fidelity)
- Excalidraw (quick sketches)
- Markdown diagrams (simple flows)
